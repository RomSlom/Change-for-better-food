The data
Extract from the call for projects :

The Open Food Facts dataset is available on the official website (or can be downloaded from this link). Variables are defined at this address.

The fields are separated into four sections:

General information about the product: name, modification date, etc.
A set of tags: product category, location, origin, etc.
Product ingredients and any additives.
Nutritional information: quantity in grams of a nutrient per 100 grams of product.
Your mission
After reading the call for projects, here are the different steps you have identified:

1) Process the dataset, by :

Brainstorming an application idea.
Identifying relevant variables for future processing, and necessary for your application idea.
Cleaning up the data by :
highlighting any missing values, with at least 3 processing methods adapted to the variables concerned,
identifying and quantifying any outliers for each variable.
Automating these processes to avoid repeating these operations.
